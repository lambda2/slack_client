# SlackClient

This is a Slack client library for Ruby. It is intended to expose all of the functionality of Slack's Real Time Messaging API while providing some common abstractions and generally making your life easier, if you want it to.

Actually, only the basics are implemented (Auth, Channels, Groups, DMs, Usera and Teams) and works with an EventMachine.
To see an example, see [Brobot](https://github.com/lambda2/Brobot)

## Installation
